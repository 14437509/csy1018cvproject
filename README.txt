So starting with the Brief,
i am to create a portfolio to represent me and my career or just something to place my work before and furture.
As brief stated i need 4 webpages

index.html - name, picture and links to other pages.

bio.html - brief information about me.

cv.html - should contain full name or handle, education,

professional experience, skills gained or learning and activities
i enjor relating to my work. Also a txt or word documented version of this page.

contact.html - a static form for viewers to request me.

Contents -
Assets - css and img - serperate css fiels for each page and images to match each section
4 html pages name accordingly lowercase



I started with the index structure and tis will carry across to the other pages
when i start this allowed easier of linking to be the same once new pages where created.

Also in the brief we wer given set criteria for how each page was built and
basically to be shorter then writing all of the briefs information i stored it in a zip package on the git
(storage device for html and other programming medians, also allows multiple client use and changes) server.

I used the common knowledge from index html to make other pages.. using image css code and replacing the url

As stated above after i figuered out the locations of flexbox and the attributes or
API it used i setup up the Main atributes, then when satisfied with the locations and the way it moved when you moved medians smaller
i copied this renamed to relevant sections and then started to resize thiose according to the webpage vision..

Conclusion
This wasnt by any means easy after the setup of the boxes due to i never know what to actually write,
but if code alone, troubles would have been actually understanding it completely and with the web ref below
i didnt find that to be completely but only in theroy... so thats why even though i know of erros or dislikes in the structure im very happy with the presentation..
These were also influenced by sites like Nike.com and Apple.com both are obvisouly built to beauty and one day maybe my code will contain JS and
other scripts to enhance the flexbox usage..

Id also of liked to work more online but for speed reason this was easier locally and
caused me issues for recording issues and fixes.. thats a BIG change that i hope next term it would imporve.
